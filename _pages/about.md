Hey! This is Yuezhe Zhang. I am a PhD candidate at [PEARL Lab](https://pearl-lab.com/), TU Darmstadt, under the supervision of [Prof. Georgia Chalvatzaki](https://pearl-lab.com/people/georgia-chalvatzaki/).

I obtained my matster degree with honours in Robotics from TU Delft. I worked on my thesis at [Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/) and [AIRLab Delft](https://icai.ai/airlab-delft/), under the supervision of [Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JydqDdEAAAAJ&hl). Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree with honours in Mechatronics Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology.

My research interests lie in the development of new integrated task and motion planning algorithms that combine fundamental concepts from optimization techniques with machine learning techniques, aiming at obtaining human-level adaptability and intelligence in real robot systems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
